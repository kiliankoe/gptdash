# GPTdash

A real-time party game based loosely on [Balderdash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash), but with AI. Players answer questions while trying to impersonate the AI, then vote to identify the real AI answer. Score points by fooling others or correctly identifying the AI!

This project was originally built for [Datenspuren 2024](https://www.datenspuren.de/2024/), also played at [Datenspuren 2025](https://www.datenspuren.de/2025/), see `/datenspuren`.

A separate version is being built for [39c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/startpage.html), see `/congress`. This version is a bit different to the previous iterations, most notably there's now a separation between players submitting answers and the audience voting on them.

There are plans to turn this into an always-online version playable whenever by small groups, we just haven't gotten around to that yet.
